Display WordPress official community WordCamps & Meetups on vector maps.

== Description ==

**Main features**

Display WordPress official community WordCamps & Meetups on vector maps. 

This plugin is based on WordCamp Central official and Meetup.com.com APIs. The WordCamps feed is now part of WordPress 4.8â€™s news widget, so why dont you use this feed to create a map of upcoming events? 

It works with shortcodes. A shortcode generator is provided in WordPress dashboard settings section. Following parameters are allowed:
*	Meetup.com API Key (a link to the key generator is provided)
*	Map's focus: World, Europe or North America (at this time. I will add other continents and localisations later)
*	Map's height
*	Display country layers or not
*	Display WordCamps or not
*	Display Meetups or not
*	WordCamps marker image
*	WordCamp marker color
*	Meetups marker image
*	Meetups marker color

Shortcode example (automatically generated by the plugin): 
`[wpce localisation="europe" height="500" countries="1" countries-color="#d2edc2" wc-display="1" wc-icon="logo" wc-color="#e5006b" mt-display="1" mt-icon="marker" mt-color="#00abb7"]`
